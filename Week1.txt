Software Engineering is the disciplined approach to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. It applies the principles of engineering to software creation to ensure that programs are reliable, efficient, and meet user requirements. Software engineering involves analyzing user needs, planning system architecture, writing and testing code, and maintaining the software after deployment. It emphasizes teamwork, documentation, and quality control throughout the development process. The field also focuses on managing time, cost, and resources to deliver software products that perform effectively and are easy to modify or upgrade. Overall, software engineering plays a vital role in building the digital solutions that power modern industries, such as mobile applications, websites, artificial intelligence systems, and embedded technologies.
